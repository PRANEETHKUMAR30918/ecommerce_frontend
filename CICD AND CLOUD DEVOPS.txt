CI/CD AND CLOUD DEVOPS


DevOps = Development(plan,code,test,build) + operations(release,deploy,monitor,operate)

-> Collaboration between development and operations teams
-> Automation of software delivery process
-> Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)
-> Improve quality and speed


->Continuous integration

      -Automatically build and test when there is a change in code
      -Ensure the bug free code
      -Ensures higher code quality and reduces integration issues
      -Packaging the application (war/jar/docker image)

-> Continuous deployment
      -Automatically deploy for production
